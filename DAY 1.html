 Q =>3  	What are the differences between var, let and const?
 Ans   These are the three diffrent way to declare or creating the variable in js

 Diffrence are:
 var is a global scope variable
 let and const are local scope variable

 At the time of memory allocation they will get their memory also at diffrent location meance
 var will be in global and let and const will be in script scope according to the browser resulting in that if you will try to access var
 keyword variable before initialization you will get undefine
 but if you will try to access variable created using let and const it will throw ref error
